    <h1>WASHINGTON MOUNTAIN: WENDIGO HISTORY</h1>
    <br>
  
    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <div class="paragraphs">
    <p>The original Wendigo legends originated from First Nation tribes who were present on Blackwood Mountain from the 1400s until the 1850s. One of these native tribes named the Cree revered in the mountain and its nature: they would hunt elsewhere in the belief that it would bring misfortune to harm any animal in the area. Additionally, they believed harming the mountain itself in any way would inflict a terrible curse.<br><br>

Eventually, European explorers and mining concerns arrived in the area, eager to make their fortune. In 1893, they officially started excavating the mountain, finding tin and, later, traces of radium. They then mined deeper into the sacred mountain. The Cree tribe claimed that the mountain cried out at that moment, and the Wendigo spirit was released, cursing the land and all its inhabitants. Soon after, the first Wendigo possessions on the mountain began, prompting Jack Fiddler’s grandfather to dedicate his life to tracking and capturing them. However, one particularly imposing creature known as the Makkapitew eluded all Wendigo hunters, killing any who were brave enough to confront it - including Jack's grandfather.<br><br>

Legend of the mountain's rich reserves bruited to more prospectors, and a group called The Blasting Crew established more mining operations in the winter of 1951-1952. Though long neglected structural weakness resulted in a tragic disaster, which caused part of the mine to cave in, with 30 miners left trapped and eventually starving for several weeks. Dozens of men were murdered and cannibalized. A rescue team later found only 12 survivors.[2] The miners who were still "missing" were hidden away in the archives, but it is clear that the survivors resorted to cannibalism to survive.<br><br>

The survivors soon began to display unusual physiological characteristics, and a cover-up ensued as they were illicitly confined in the Blackwood Pines Sanatorium for study. On the orders of Sanatorium owner as well as mines and hotel establisher Jefferson Bragg, staff observed and experimented on the miners as they swiftly mutated into Wendigos. Eventually, these miners who turned into Wendigos broke out of confinement and slaughtered the Sanatorium staff, prompting the immediate shutdown of the Sanatorium and the North West Mines. This left the mountain deserted with the exception of the Wendigos and Jack Fiddler, who, during the decades that followed, tracked down each transformed miner and successfully captured them one by one, keeping them contained in the abandoned Sanatorium they broke out of, while he hunted any other Wendigo that happened to emerge on the mountain.<br><br>

In 1997, famous movie mogul Bob Washington was presented with the golden opportunity to buy Blackwood Mountain, and he could not possibly refuse. Though before his plans came to fruition, he was warned vehemently by Fiddler, who desperately tried to stop the construction, claiming that the land was sacred to his forefathers. Bob Washington, however, refused to listen and aspects of the mountain were restored in working order and so the luxurious Washington Lodge was built, creating a perfect getaway for Bob Washington and his family.<br><br>

More than a decade later, in 2014, the children of Bob and his wife Melinda Washington, Josh and twins Hannah and Beth, invited their friends Ashley, Chris, Emily, Matt, Jessica, Mike and Sam to their family lodge for a weekend of good times. However, after some of the friends played a prank on Hannah, she fled the lodge into the woods during a snowstorm, followed by Beth. The pair soon realized they weren't alone as the Makkapitew, still roaming free, began chasing after them while Jack Fiddler was hunting it. Before Jack could kill the Wendigo, it forced the sisters over a cliff edge, causing them to fall into a mine slope, killing Beth instantly. Hannah, however, survived her fall with a broken leg. After a month of no rescue, Hannah found herself having to make a desperate decision as she ate the flesh of her sister to survive. Soon after, Hannah became stronger: her transformation into a Wendigo began.<br><br>

Exactly one year later, the group of friends return to the lodge after being invited by Josh, to commemorate the twins and have a get-together like they used to. Things quickly go south, however, as Hannah, now a complete Wendigo roaming free on the mountain, stalks and potentially kills the friends throughout the night. By the end of the game, regardless of the number of survivors, all the Wendigos are successfully wiped out by the friends. However, if Josh survived, he may be stuck in the mines and end up eating Jack's head, continuing the curse of Blackwood.</p>

<h1>APPEARANCE</h1>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>Wendigos exhibit a drastic mutation of human anatomy, acquiring a disfigured yet powerful form. Being the embodiment of hunger, they lose much of their muscle mass and have prominent bones while limbs become longer, gaining a slender and skeletal appearance. This also makes the creatures considerably taller than the average person, half or twice the height depending on how much they feed. They exhibit spinal disfiguration, which gives them a hunchback-like appearance but allows to move around on both two and four limbs. The skin is pale white with bulging dark veins, taut against bodies much like a glossy, stretched armor, and suffer from different forms of torture, such as sweating acids that strengthen the outer coating. Most Wendigos are bald and lack of any hair, but some are exceptions and have a slight gray body hair, which may be related to age. The teeth lengthen and deform, becoming more canine, the nails are longer and sharper as well. Wendigo's vision is less keen, as evidenced by their visibly milky white eyes. <br><br>
During metamorphosis, possessed humans, while suffering from body horrors mentioned earlier, eventually lose all male and female characteristics, acquiring an identical genderless appearance. However, Wendigos will retain any alterations they had on their skin as humans, like Hannah's tattoo and Billy's scar, which allows to identify them. Furthermore, Wendigos shown in the game managed to retain some of the clothes in which they transformed, such as the miners' work uniforms. <br><br>
Although Wendigos are shown to have physical bodies, they are actually immaterial spirits. Their true appearance can be seen after killing a Wendigo with fire and takes the form of a small fireball. Upon closer look, a glimpse of the Wendigo's screaming face can be seen.</p>
</div>

<h1>CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
  <p>Wendigos are shown to be extremely deadly creatures. Their anatomy allows them to move not only on two legs, but on four legs as well, being capable of crawling on any surface and leaping to different spots in the blink of the eye. Although they look emaciated, Wendigos are abnormally strong, easily lifting heavy objects and tearing their victims apart, even able to kill other Wendigos with bare hands; the Doctor's Report documents one lifting 725 lb weights. This strength depends on how the Wendigo feeds, as the miners, starving for several years, couldn't free themselves from the chains. The skin is extremely hard like armor, which renders the Wendigos practically impervious against ballistics and sharp weapons and also allows them to feel no pain. However, some heavy firearms, such as shotguns and hunting rifles, can stun Wendigos for a short period of time. The extreme heat from fire and explosives can burn away the thick skin and inflict great pain. In cases where fire causes non-fatal injuries, it makes the Wendigos completely vulnerable and allows them to be killed with any other weapon, even the simple shovel or pipe. They are shown to be able to be killed by beheading as well, and this doesn't release their spirits. <br><br>

Wendigos are recorded to have some set behavior patterns. They are nocturnal creatures, inactive during the day and hunting exclusively at night. They also make excellent predators, being able to easily navigate the mountain and find prey wherever they are and then follow them for a very long time without being noticed. While acting like wild animals, as former humans, Wendigos retain some of the intelligence and can use clever tricks to lure out their prey. For example, Hannah throws Jessica's phone through the window to get her to leave the cabin, cuts the support lines to drop the fire tower with Emily and Matt down the mines and mimics Jessica's voice to get Ashley and/or Chris to open the trapdoor. Not only that, while killing her victims, regardless of the method, Hannah tends to always decapitate them and keep their heads as some sort of trophies. In relation to each other, unfamiliar Wendigos are mostly aggressive and always attack, possibly seeing the others as prey, a way to reduce competition for food or territory and/or quench their thirst to kill.<br><br>
Wendigos have unique vision. Although much worse than humans, they become more susceptible to movement: mobile objects are highlighted in their eyes, otherwise they are unable to track things that stand still. Because of this feature, Wendigos don't see the difference between an ordinary item and real prey, which can be used to catch them, even if the trap is obvious. Jack exploits this weakness by setting bear traps baited with human limbs, which move through a mechanism. While searching, Wendigos sometimes use prolonged high-pitched screams to scare prey into moving and revealing their position. <br><br>
Upon transformation into the Wendigo, humans gradually become aggressive and lose their minds. However, they are able to retain fragments of humanity and memories from their past lives, especially their closest people. The miners never attack one another and even form a sort of pack due to being close friends as humans. Hannah spares her brother Josh after they recognize each other and also never kills Mike on the spot (though can mortally wound him), suggesting that she has retained a part of her affection for him. On the other hand, while other Wendigos mostly just slash their prey with their claws, Hannah shows cruel sadism to her former friends, killing them in slow, bloody and painful ways (decapitation, eye gouging, impalement, etc.). <br><br>

Wendigos are not just physical beings, but rather supernatural spirits embodying cold and hunger. They are drawn to people who have committed an act of cannibalism on the mountain and possess them, initiating an irreversible transformation. It's worth noting that cannibalism is the only way to become a Wendigo and they are not contagious through bites or scratches. The Wendigo's main weakness is fire, which not only causes damage, but can kill them. However, it is advised to use it only as a last resort, as Wendigos are effectively immortal and after death their spirit will break free, waiting for the next victims.</p>
