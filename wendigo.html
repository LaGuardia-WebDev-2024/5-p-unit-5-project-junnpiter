    <h1>WASHINGTON MOUNTAIN: WENDIGO REPORTS</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <p>The original Wendigo legends originated from First Nation tribes who were present on Blackwood Mountain from the 1400s until the 1850s. One of these native tribes named the Cree revered in the mountain and its nature: they would hunt elsewhere in the belief that it would bring misfortune to harm any animal in the area. Additionally, they believed harming the mountain itself in any way would inflict a terrible curse.<br><br>

Eventually, European explorers and mining concerns arrived in the area, eager to make their fortune. In 1893, they officially started excavating the mountain, finding tin and, later, traces of radium. They then mined deeper into the sacred mountain. The Cree tribe claimed that the mountain cried out at that moment, and the Wendigo spirit was released, cursing the land and all its inhabitants. Soon after, the first Wendigo possessions on the mountain began, prompting Jack Fiddler’s grandfather to dedicate his life to tracking and capturing them. However, one particularly imposing creature known as the Makkapitew eluded all Wendigo hunters, killing any who were brave enough to confront it - including Jack's grandfather.<br><br>

Legend of the mountain's rich reserves bruited to more prospectors, and a group called The Blasting Crew established more mining operations in the winter of 1951-1952. Though long neglected structural weakness resulted in a tragic disaster, which caused part of the mine to cave in, with 30 miners left trapped and eventually starving for several weeks. Dozens of men were murdered and cannibalized. A rescue team later found only 12 survivors.[2] The miners who were still "missing" were hidden away in the archives, but it is clear that the survivors resorted to cannibalism to survive.<br><br>

The survivors soon began to display unusual physiological characteristics, and a cover-up ensued as they were illicitly confined in the Blackwood Pines Sanatorium for study. On the orders of Sanatorium owner as well as mines and hotel establisher Jefferson Bragg, staff observed and experimented on the miners as they swiftly mutated into Wendigos. Eventually, these miners who turned into Wendigos broke out of confinement and slaughtered the Sanatorium staff, prompting the immediate shutdown of the Sanatorium and the North West Mines. This left the mountain deserted with the exception of the Wendigos and Jack Fiddler, who, during the decades that followed, tracked down each transformed miner and successfully captured them one by one, keeping them contained in the abandoned Sanatorium they broke out of, while he hunted any other Wendigo that happened to emerge on the mountain.<br><br>

In 1997, famous movie mogul Bob Washington was presented with the golden opportunity to buy Blackwood Mountain, and he could not possibly refuse. Though before his plans came to fruition, he was warned vehemently by Fiddler, who desperately tried to stop the construction, claiming that the land was sacred to his forefathers. Bob Washington, however, refused to listen and aspects of the mountain were restored in working order and so the luxurious Washington Lodge was built, creating a perfect getaway for Bob Washington and his family.<br><br>

More than a decade later, in 2014, the children of Bob and his wife Melinda Washington, Josh and twins Hannah and Beth, invited their friends Ashley, Chris, Emily, Matt, Jessica, Mike and Sam to their family lodge for a weekend of good times. However, after some of the friends played a prank on Hannah, she fled the lodge into the woods during a snowstorm, followed by Beth. The pair soon realized they weren't alone as the Makkapitew, still roaming free, began chasing after them while Jack Fiddler was hunting it. Before Jack could kill the Wendigo, it forced the sisters over a cliff edge, causing them to fall into a mine slope, killing Beth instantly. Hannah, however, survived her fall with a broken leg. After a month of no rescue, Hannah found herself having to make a desperate decision as she ate the flesh of her sister to survive. Soon after, Hannah became stronger: her transformation into a Wendigo began.<br><br>

Exactly one year later, the group of friends return to the lodge after being invited by Josh, to commemorate the twins and have a get-together like they used to. Things quickly go south, however, as Hannah, now a complete Wendigo roaming free on the mountain, stalks and potentially kills the friends throughout the night. By the end of the game, regardless of the number of survivors, all the Wendigos are successfully wiped out by the friends. However, if Josh survived, he may be stuck in the mines and end up eating Jack's head, continuing the curse of Blackwood.</p>
